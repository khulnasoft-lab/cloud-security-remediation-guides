# ORACLE / Identity / Policy Least Privilege

## Quick Info

| | |
|-|-|
| **Plugin Title** | Policy Least Privilege |
| **Cloud** | ORACLE |
| **Category** | Identity |
| **Description** | Ensure only service-level admins have blanket statements to manage or use resources without restriction. |
| **More Info** | Adding service-level admins to Oracle policies instead of blanket statements mitigates unintended access to resources by unauthorized users or groups. |
| **ORACLE Link** | https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/iam_security.htm |
| **Recommended Action** | When writing policies, avoid blanket statements, and instead give full permissions only to Service-level admins, all other groups should have least access to services. |

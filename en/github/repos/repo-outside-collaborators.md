## Quick Info

| **Cloud** | GITHUB |
| **Category** | Repos |
| **Description** | Ensures organization repositories do not have outside collaborators with admin or push permissions. |
| **More Info** | Allowing outside collaborators admin or push access to organization repositories places the organization at risk from non-member contributions that can be pushed without review. |
| **GITHUB Link** | https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization |
| **Recommended Action** | For outside collaborators that need access to organization code, provide read access and require the collaborator to fork the repo and submit a pull request that can be reviewed by organization members. |
